Molding Casting And roland modela<br />
The basic idea for this session is to create an object through computer and try to make it in machinable wax in such a way that a molding pattern can be created directly from it. Roland modelais used to machine the object. in such and cast a silicone to<br />
We have Various smooth on resins to play with for molding and casting.<br />
Smooth on plastic oomoo 25<br />
Smooth on plastic oomoo 30<br />
Smooth on plastic oomoo 65 <br />
Smooth On rubber(silicone)<br />
<br />
The different numbers are suppsed to mean they have different physical properties such as setting time, hardness, safety precautions,shelf life etc. <br />
<br />
These resins have a short life span(estimated 6moths) and we seem to have a loads of them unused for a long time. We need to find a local supplier or a local alternative for smooth on because smooth on is a high quality product meant for artists and expensive. Here we are mostly interested in prototyping.<br />
<br />
It is very important to read the instructions and product catalog to understand the chemicals beter, how to handle them and to know what product suits your need.<br />
The Smooth on here are the polyurethane plastic and silicone. The product come in two different part, Part A and Part B which are supposed to be mixed in 1:1 ratio and this mix will set in sometime. The setting time aka pot time, which is also the time you'll get to work the material into the mold and prepare it.<br />
<br />
Roland modela is a mini desktop cnc milling machine which is popular for making milling traces on pcbs and for milling machinable wax.<br />
it uses a type of mechanism that uses steel wire much like brake line wires to translate without an backlash.<br />

Milling machinable wax in rolland<br />
we tried to mill a machinable wax. we had a dark blue looking machinable wax. Interesting is that this machinable wax seemed to be a lower quality material. I think it might be more suspetible to melting rather than geting milled of. the properties can be improved by adding HPFE a polythelene that is reusable and is found in common places like supermarket stores etc.<br />
